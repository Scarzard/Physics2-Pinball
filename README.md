### Differences

- Original game: 

	- Score is shown in-game.
	- All the balls are spawned at the beginning.
	- The tornado situated on the left makes the ball spin and when it falls to the hole it spawns on top of the map. 

- Our game:

	- Score is shown in the tilte with the number of lifes.
	- One ball is spawned and respawned when the player loses one life.
	- The tornado only spawns the ball on top of the map when it falls to the hole.

### Combo implemented

- While the three top stars are lightened the score that you gain is multiplied by 2.
